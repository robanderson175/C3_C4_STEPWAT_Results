# C3_C4_STEPWAT_Results
Data to produce results from the paper "Climate change and C4 and C3 grasses in a midlatitude dryland steppe"

The main R script is the STEPWAT_Analysis.Rmd. This takes the raw output of the STEPWAT model (unable to provide due to file size, see Stepwat_Stats_FULL.csv for the consolidated version of STEPWAT output used throughout the code). The other main script is the BOGR_Matching_and_Expanding.Rmd. This code was used to find field sites to search and to produce the extrapolated area that B. gracilis could be found in the Upper Green River Basin. The other two scripts were small steps required to produce inputs for STEPWAT.

All other files are those required for the scripts to run. The Final_BOGR_Points.csv may be of interest as the final list of sites in the UGRB where BOGR was found.
